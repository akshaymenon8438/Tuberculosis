# Tuberculosis
Predicting Tuberculosis using Transfer learning Technique
Pulmonary TB is a widespread disease, and early detection is crucial to treating TB. The estimated TB burden in 2020 is between 48000 to 107000, with only 61 percent getting medical treatment as notified.The motive of our project is to detect Tuberculosis from chest x-ray using transfer learning method to gather detection outcome  within a less time.
